        After the Indian Independence Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its army to
        patrol the country's border. In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike for the
        job. In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company
        partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal
        Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they
        could manufacture components.[7] By 1962, all components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the
        1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc
        and 500 cc models, along with several different models
